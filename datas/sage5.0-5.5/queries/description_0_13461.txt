Trac #13461: When the WeylCharacterRing is made with style="coroots", uses the Demazure
character formula instead of the Freudenthal multiplicity formula as the
basic work engine. This is a substantial speedup on long calculations:
sage -t -long weyl_characters.py is about 2.5 times faster. For short
calculations, it is a minor slowdown: sage -t weyl_character.py is a
little slower.

Also Demazure operators and Demazure-Lusztig operators are implemented as
methods of WeightRing elements.
