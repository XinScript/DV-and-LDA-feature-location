Trac #12875: #12875: Fix the homset category initialization for ModularAbelianVariety's homspaces

Before the patch, the following was wrong (probably introduced by #9138):
{{{
    sage: End(J0(37)).homset_category()
    Join of Category of hom sets in Category of sets and Category of rings
}}}

After the patch:
{{{
    sage: End(J0(37)).homset_category()
    Category of modular abelian varieties over Rational Field
}}}

In both cases, we have, as desired:
{{{
    sage: End(J0(37)).category()
    Join of Category of hom sets in Category of sets and Category of rings
}}}

By the way, this removes a direct call to _Hom_, using Hom instead.
