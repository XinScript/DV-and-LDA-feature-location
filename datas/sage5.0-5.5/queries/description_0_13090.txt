Trac #13090: allow LinearCode to take minimum distance as a parameter
  - this allows us to store the minimum distance computations, once done
  - also, we can provide the minimum distance in the initialization of known codes
  - algorithm="gap" parameter is introduced to recompute the minimum distance if so desired.
