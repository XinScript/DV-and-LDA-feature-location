Trac #12605: Trac 12605 - change default color of circles and ellipses back to blue

When graph plotting was improved, the default color for circles was changed
to black. This reverts that change and improves documentation.  It also corrects
ellipses.
Additionally, we improve the graph plot doc a little and add it to the plot part
of the reference manual in addition to the graphs part (Sphinx only creates one
page, so it is not a problem).
