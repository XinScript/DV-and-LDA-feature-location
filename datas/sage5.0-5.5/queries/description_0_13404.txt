Trac #13404: Improved printing for symmetric function bases and misc refactoring

- Refactored the printing to have more consistent output in less code
- Reduced code duplication in dual_basis by introducing dual_basis_default
- Moved a couple methods from SymmetricFunctions_classical and friends
  to the category SymmetricFunctionsBases
- Changed the prefix for the LLT spin basis from HSp to HSp3 (or in
  general HSp<level> to be consistent with the cospin basis
- Updated to doctests in jack.py: the new outputs are equal but
  not identical to the previous ones. Why did it change?
- Changed repr functions in new_kschur.py to reflect consistent naming convention
