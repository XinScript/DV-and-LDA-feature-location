Trac #8659: Trac 8659: remove sage.symbolic.power_helper in favor of hold=True

sage.symbolic.power_helper module uses a hack to prevent running into infinite
loops when evaluating powers like 2^(1/2). In these cases, the symbolics
library would call the rational __pow__() method again when trying to simplify
this expression further. Using the hold functionality merged in #9878, we can
prevent automatic evalution of power expressions. Thus
sage.symbolic.power_helper module is not needed any more.
