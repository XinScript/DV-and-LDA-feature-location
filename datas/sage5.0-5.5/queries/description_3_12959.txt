Trac #12959: Improvements to Sets.WithRealizations
Implement default methods for (With)Realizations that use the realization
provided by the method a_realization for computations:

- AlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.product is modified to use
  product_by_coercion if product_on_basis is not available
- Magmas.Realizations added and
  Magmas.Realizations.ParentMethods.product_by_coercion uses
  self.a_realization()
- CommutativeAdditiveMonoids.WithRealizations added and
  CommutativeAdditiveMonoids.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.zero
  returns self.a_realization().zero()
- Monoids.WithRealizations added and Monoids.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.one
  returns self.a_realization().one()
- Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.inject_shorthands : injects any
  shorthands names for realizations provided in the _shorthands attribute
- added _shorthand attribute to the example in
  sage.categories.example.with_realizations
